                <p>“I'm so happy that I suddenly feel cold, tenatized by a joy that freezes me. He says 'I'm wrecked, I traveled all day hitchhiking to catch up with you, let's go to your hotel.' I had only dreamed and dream of nothing but the moment I would find myself alone with him in my hotel room, and yet my lips drily reply, 'We'll go later, let's go to the screening first.' At the end of the screening, Vincent announces that he's leaving again; a burning misery follows an icy joy.”</p>
                <p>“Quinn had never stayed at a hotel that used real keys. Most had plastic keycards--like credit cards that you slide through a sensor--though her aunt Deirdre had told her about a tiny hotel in Paris she'd once stayed at that still had brass keys attached to enormous key chains shaped like the Eiffel Tower.”</p>

            <p>“Everything was handled efficiently and empathically; from booking over the phone prior to travel to the actual stay as well as checkout, everyone was courteous and helpful. I was in quarantine with my elderly parents and your staff went above and beyond to help us.”

            <p>“Staff were friendly and helpful. Shame about the inflexible hotel policy, which meant that we could not stay for an additional night of isolation once our negative test result came back. That night was refunded but we inquired about staying for an additional night at normal rates instead of quarantine rates and were told it was not possible. Strange and disappointing.”</p>
