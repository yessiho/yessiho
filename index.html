            <h2><span class="text-primary">The History</span> Of Our Hotel</h2>
            <p>
                The history of hotel is intimately connected to that of civilizations. Or rather, it is a part of that history. Facilities offering guest hospitality have been in evidence since early biblical times. The Greeks developed thermal baths in villages designed for rest and recuperation. Later, the Romans built mansions to provide accommodation for travelers on government business. The Romans were the first to develop thermal baths in England, Switzerland and the Middle East. Later still, caravanserais appeared providing a resting place for caravans along Middle Eastern routes. In the Middle Ages, monasteries and abbeys were the first establishments to offer refuge to travelers on a regular basis.
